Being A Living Creature With Soul.

It was in late 2018, that I realised that I had been learning from my friends, my neighbours, people on Internet for many years without paying a penny; that many people around the world had been helping me without asking me for anything.

When I want to cook a new recipe, I would watch online video; when I have technical challenge in working, I would do search over internet; when I need amusement, I would listen music; when I study Japanese language, I would read NHK online articles; and when ... ..., the list can go on and on. Yet, until recently, I failed to realise that all the information which I got on Internet is, actually, the contribution from others.

Hence, I want to pay back to the Internet community by sharing some humble computer knowledge that I have grasped. And I hope that you would start contributing to our Internet community or your community if you found the information, knowledge and skills here is of any helpful to you. After all, it is this key point (helping each other) which keeps our Internet community thriving in the past 20 or more years. And it is this same key point which helps us build a better world.

And lastly, what I share here are things, skills and tips which I do not think SUPER valuable to me any more, therefore, I would not actively maintain or update this repository under most circumstance.
