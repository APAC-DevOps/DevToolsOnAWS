Being A Living Creature With Soul.

It was in late 2018, that I realised that I had been learning from my friends, my neighbours, people on Internet for many years without paying a penny; that many people around the world had been helping me without asking me for anything.

When I want to cook a new recipe, I would watch online video; when I have technical challenge in working, I would do search over internet; when I need amusement, I would listen music; when I study Japanese language, I would read NHK online articles; and when ... ..., the list can go on and on. Yet, until recently, I failed to realise that all the information which I got on Internet is, actually, the contribution from others.

Hence, I want to pay back to the Internet community by sharing some humble computer knowledge that I have grasped.
